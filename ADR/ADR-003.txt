Title
	Azure Computer Vision for Return Validation

Status
	Accepted

Context
	Customers must submit photos proving vehicle return to designated spots. We need automated validation of parking location, vehicle condition, and charging cable connection for cars/vans. Manual review is not scalable. We evaluated AWS Rekognition, Google Vision API, and Azure Computer Vision.

Decision
	We will use Azure Computer Vision and Azure Custom Vision for photo validation and damage detection.

Consequences
	Positive:
		- Pre-trained models handle common scenarios (object detection, scene analysis)
		- Custom Vision allows training damage-specific models with our fleet images
		- Direct integration with Azure Blob Storage for photo uploads
		- Real-time inference via REST API or containerized deployment
		- Lower latency for Azure-hosted mobile app backend
		- Can process images on-device using exported ONNX models

	Negative:
		- Custom model training requires labeled dataset (initial manual effort)
		- Model accuracy depends on photo quality (lighting, angles, weather)
		- False positives may frustrate customers if parking is incorrectly flagged
		- Need fallback to human review for edge cases (increases operational cost)
		- Ongoing model retraining needed as vehicle types and damage patterns evolve
