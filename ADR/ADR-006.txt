Title
	Azure Data Explorer for IoT Time-Series Data

Status
	Accepted

Context
	GPS trackers on all vehicles generate location, battery level, and status data every 30 seconds. This produces millions of events daily. We need fast ingestion, efficient storage, and real-time queries for battery monitoring, geofence alerts, and demand prediction features. We evaluated InfluxDB,  AWS Timestream, and Azure Data Explorer.

Decision
	We will use Azure Data Explorer as the time-series database for all IoT telemetry data.

Consequences
	Positive:
		- Purpose-built for high-volume time-series ingestion
		- KQL query language optimized for time-series analytics and aggregations
		- Native integration with Azure IoT Hub and Event Hubs
		- Automatic data compression reduces storage costs 
		- Fast queries for geospatial data using geo_point types
		- Direct connector to Azure ML for feature engineering
		- Built-in anomaly detection functions for battery health monitoring

	Negative:
		- KQL learning curve for team familiar with SQL
		- Minimum cluster cost may be expensive for early stage
		- Not ideal for transactional queries 
		- Data retention policies needed to control costs
