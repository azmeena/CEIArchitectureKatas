Title
	Google Maps Platform for Route Optimization

Status
	Accepted

Context
	Staff need optimized routes to swap batteries in bikes/scooters and relocate vehicles to high-demand areas. Routes must account for real-time traffic, multiple stops (up to 20-30 per shift), and vehicle capacity constraints. We evaluated Google Maps Platform,  and Azure Maps. While Azure Maps would provide better platform integration, routing quality and optimization capabilities are mission-critical for operational efficiency.

Decision
	We will use Google Maps Platform (Routes API and Route Optimization API) for staff routing, integrated with Azure ML for battery swap prioritization.

Consequences
	Positive:
		- Industry-leading routing quality with most accurate real-time traffic data
		- Route Optimization API supports up to 100 stops with time windows and vehicle constraints
		- Superior geocoding and place data for parking bay validation
		- Extensive global coverage with consistent quality across MobilityCorp's multiple cities
		- Rich SDKs and documentation reduce development time
		- Can leverage Google OR-Tools for advanced constraint satisfaction problems
		- Proven reliability and uptime (99.9% SLA)

	Negative:
		- Additional vendor relationship outside Azure ecosystem 
		- API keys and authentication separate from Microsoft Entra ID
		- Higher cost than Azure Maps 
		- Network latency for Azure-to-Google API calls (50-100ms additional roundtrip)
		- Need secure key management in Azure Key Vault for Google API credentials
		- Monitoring split across Azure Monitor and Google Cloud Console
		- Potential integration complexity with Azure ML pipelines
