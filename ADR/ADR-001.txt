Title
	Azure Cloud Platform

Status
	Accepted

Context
	MobilityCorp needs a cloud platform to host AI services for demand prediction, battery optimization, personalization, and vision AI. The platform must support ML model training, real-time IoT data processing, geospatial services, and enterprise-grade security. We need reliable uptime for customer-facing services and staff operations across multiple regions.

Decision
	We will use Microsoft Azure as our primary cloud platform for all AI and core services.

Consequences
	Positive:
		- Unified ecosystem reduces integration complexity across AI services
		- Single vendor relationship simplifies procurement and support
		- Enterprise SLAs and compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
		- Azure OpenAI provides enterprise-grade LLM access with data privacy guarantees
		- BLOB storage for unstructured and different variety of data
	Negative:
		- Vendor lock-in risk if Azure services change pricing or features
		- Team needs Azure-specific training and certifications
		- Potential higher costs compared to multi-cloud approach for specific workloads
