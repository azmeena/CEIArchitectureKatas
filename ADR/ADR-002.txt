Title
	Azure OpenAI Service for Personalization

Status
	Accepted

Context
	We need to convert ad-hoc users into regular commuters through personalized recommendations, smart notifications, and conversational engagement. The solution must understand user behavior patterns, generate natural language messages, and provide context-aware suggestions. We considered OpenAI API directly, Claude API, and Azure OpenAI Service.

Decision
	We will use Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-5) as the primary LLM provider for the Personalization Engine.

Consequences
	Positive:
		- Enterprise data privacy - customer data stays within Azure tenant
		- Seamless integration with Azure ML and Application Insights
		- Managed service with SLA guarantees and reliability
		- Virtual network isolation and Microsoft Entra ID authentication
		- Content filtering and abuse monitoring built-in
		- Same GPT-5 models as OpenAI with enterprise controls
		- Azure AI foundry will allow changing the LLM if needed

	Negative:
		- Slightly higher latency than direct OpenAI API (additional network hop)
		- Limited model selection compared to direct OpenAI access
		- Regional availability constraints may affect deployment locations
		- May need abstraction layer (custom wrapper) to maintain provider flexibility
