##Decision Criteria for Analysis

For each alternative solution, please evaluate , Technical Factors, Business Factors and Operational Factors

##Specific Questions to Address

1. AI Platform Comparison: How does Azure OpenAI's enterprise data privacy compare to direct OpenAI API usage? What are the trade-offs in latency and cost?

2. Multi-Cloud vs. Single Cloud: Given our Google Maps dependency, should we consider a broader multi-cloud strategy? What are the integration challenges?

3. Database Strategy Validation: Is our Cosmos DB + SQL hybrid approach optimal, or would a single database solution (like PostgreSQL with time-series extensions) be simpler?

4. Open Source vs. Managed: We chose open-source ML libraries (Prophet, XGBoost) over fully managed solutions. What are the long-term maintenance implications?

5. Edge Computing: Should we consider edge deployment for any of our AI models, particularly for vehicle-based processing?

6. Cost Optimization: Which alternative architectures would provide better cost efficiency at our expected scale (thousands of vehicles, millions of daily events)?

##Deliverable

Please provide a comprehensive competitive analysis that:
- Validates our Azure-centric choices with objective comparisons
- Identifies potential risks or blind spots in our current architecture
